The Open Ended Capstone originally utilized Google Places API to gather restaurant data but do to the expensive pricing model to 
accurately obtain all establishments within the United States, the method was scrapped. During the year of 2014, Google Places API's tier pricing
was much more affordable so the source data within this product was purchased by a private data scraping website. The purchased dataset did not provide full
business details such as reviews, ratings, and business status. To combat this issue, the open ended capstone utilized Google Cloud Compute Engine to take
advantage of running algorithms through multiple nodes to avoid IP address blocks and to maintain a competitive data mining timeframe. Unfortunately,
due to Google Cloud's operating terms the virtual machines were terminated after a random amount of running hours. The workload may have to be migrated
to an AWS environment to run reserved instances. Due to a lack of financial resources the latter option was unable to be run. 

While more source data may provide supplemental information to the current purchased restaurants dataset, the current csv file inputted as the 
source dataset within Azure Data Factory. Azure SQL Database along with a direct connection to Microsoft SQL SERVER Management Studio was set as the
sink or destination data storage solution. The data has been successfully trasnferred into a SQL format to be stored in a secured manner within the
Microsoft Azure environment.
